Version 1.7.2 Released on 2008/11/28

	* Fix wrong use of “available” keys. If a key was set to the empty string in the local configuration to delete a key, when appending a new value, the key right after the available one was assigned to it (thus “shifted”). Closes: #1179.

Version 1.7.1 Released on 2008/11/26

Version 1.6.1 Released on 2008/11/21

	* Fix the “conf_typed” method, that was returning values transformed by plugins for their configuration files. Closes: #1137.

	* Add sjconf manual page. Closes: #820.
	* Allow “%” in local.conf. Closes: #822.
	* Rename “distrib” to “profile” since the latter is much more appropriate to
	the actual semantic in sjconf.
	* Profiles are now multi-level and a level can have several profiles. Closes: #826.
	* Profiles are now selected in the “sjconf” section of the local.conf file.
	* When adding to a list or sequence, the new value is now added to the “base” and/or “profile” previous value if it is not defined in the “local” configuration.

	* Default "conf_class" method uses Plugin.Conf it it exists. Refs: #739.
	* Default "conf_section_class" method Plugin.Conf.ConfSection if it exists, or Plugin.ConfSection if it exists. Closes: #739.

	* The "Conf" class can save the configuration in an "IO" object.
	* Plugins can use regular expression when setting types of configuration options.
